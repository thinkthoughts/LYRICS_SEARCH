[Verse 1: billy woods]
Quinine powder and alcohol, stir until dissolved
The future isn't flying cars, it's Rachel Dolezal absolved
It's autonomous computers sendin' shooters back in time at the behest of defunct message boards
Translucent man-of-war, the tentacles caress my paramour
Implored the bitch to be sensible
The slave master's children all looked identical
True, the future is children, but whatever future you buildin' already look misеrable
Natural beauty, Savage Fеnty, we strip mined the minerals
The trailer is the movie, Bobby Digital


[Refrain: billy woods]
Said he had a vision, said he had a system
Said he was the one true and living, said he had a mission
Said we in a prison
Said he had a vision, said he had a system
Said he was the one true and living, said he had a mission
Said we in a prison

[Verse 2: ELUCID]
I do a dance from '86, I'm a simple machine
Hammering the myth, pullin' it from the extreme
The only answer sits, sits right in between
She been playin' in my scalp 'bout an hour it seem
In a place called now buyin' flowers and leaves
Black soap, crack, choke under masonic sword
From where they tax hold two thousand dollar reward
Found on the road, dead, pulling cotton from thorns
Scary hour, heretic, kicks canary
Travel Fox, wouldn't step in blood, wouldn't [?]
Bend the bitch one-eighty, what she asked for
I been playin' in her ass more
Hand of God, slept walked from Land of Nod
Heavy lidded, past door front, tabernacle door, seeing everything
Unknown pleasure from the belly sing
My name already ring
My neighbor never a word but always listening
Thin walls, scream a full word
No convincin' 'em

Akh said he had a vision, said he had a system
Said he was the one true and living, said he had a mission
Said we in a prison
Said he had a vision, said he had a system
Said he was the one true and living, said he had a mission
Said we in a prison
Said he had a vision, say he had a system
Said he was the one true and living, said he had a mission
Said we in a prison

[Verse 3: Denmark Vessey]
Medu Neter in a love letter
Dove tears in the inkwell for a dove feather
I make a dovetail when I spread the bills, blood money
Heard blood sells, said it was a gimmick
Sex sells, the Lord said I must replenish
Get out my light, you already in my image
My eyes can meet your twinkle and glisten
Jeremy Scotts on my ankle, in prison
This the flow that got Ponzi scheme written all over it
Seen the ball of black slime, I pump fake a whole [piston?]
Got infrared Jesus posted jumpin' out the prism
Primary colors for prescription
I prefer my bluntin' smothered in addiction (Yeah)
Subjugation is the mother of invention
Someone's pain is some other motherfucker's pension
Your daddy was a rich man, stole an invention
[Refrain: Denmark Vessey & Quelle Chris]
Said he had a vision, said he had a mission (Said he had a)
Said he was the one true and living, said he had a system (Said he had a system)
Said he had a mission (Said he had a mission)
(Said he had a mission)
Said he had a (Said he had a)
Said he had a

[Verse 4: Quelle Chris]
Said he had a mission
Some niggas run when they see niggas runnin'
Some niggas run and see
I be the latter
Four thousand years after King James claimed God's great (Who, me?)
I said I'm flattered, time hoppin' like Peabody and Sherm
Eyes bleedin' like Giuliani, peaking, felt little concern
My imperfection's impressive, take L's to the chest like Laverne
Used to rock a tar baby perm, Brer Rabbit habit
Moves documented by the coons
And all the gatekeepers walk pageant
Ooh, delicioso, fresh madness, steamin'
Right up out the pot, no seasonin'
E'rybody wanna be the next big thing to pop out Mother Nature's gato breathin'
Spells, chants, incantations, readings
Yeah, nigga, it's all that
Niggas thought we was writin' raps and we manipulate seasons
That's no cap and all caps at the same time
[?] Maasai walks the same line
Canonically and sonically, I was in the same mind
Don't need four or five g's to call shots like a land line
Straight from the spine, handle mine
Sidesteppin' like it's hammer time
Deep cut so fire that it cauterizes
